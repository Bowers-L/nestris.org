/*
A room describes everyone involved in a tetris match (or game for soloplayer)
A room has a list of players (one for solo, two for multiplayer), a list of spectators,
and an optional “referee”, used specifically for unranked matches for the purposes of restream etc
Without a referee, match state is updated automatically by the server

A player can only be in one room at a time

Players stream their inputs to the server, which then broadcasts the inputs to all other players in the room.
The room tracks the game status of each of the players, caches the game state for each ongoing game, and
saves the game state to the database when the game ends.

This also works for singleplayer - there are no other players or spectators so nothing gets broadcasted,
but the room still tracks the game state and saves it to the database when the game ends.
